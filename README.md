# Weather Dashboard
This project is a simple dashboard that uses the <a href="https://openweathermap.org/api">OpenWeather API</a> to display weather forecasts for any city. Users receive detailed current information as well as more general forecasts for the next 5 days. Previous searches are stored, displayed, and clickable.
